_Interaction nets_ are a local graph rewriting formalism introduced by Yves Lafont in 1989. A particular interaction net is an undirected graph of **agents** connected through their **principal** & **auxiliary** ports; two agents connected through their principal ports form an **active pair**. By fixing (1) a set of **interaction rules** for reducing active pairs & (2) a suitable reduction strategy, we can evaluate the entire net to a normal form by repeatedly firing appropriate rules, until there are no more active pairs in the net. Since interaction nets were introduced, they have been mainly used for LÃ©vy-optimal implementations of the lambda calculus, yet they constitute a universal model of computation, & can therefore serve as efficient implementations of conventional programming languages. Unlike more traditional computing formalisms, duplication and erasing are dealt with explicitly, allowing for a very high degree of sharing.

This is a collection of resources for studying interaction nets & their applications, ranging from introductory materials to advanced papers. Any questions regarding interaction nets will be welcomed in the issues.
